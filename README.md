# About
Hi! I'm Angela, a 3rd-year Computer Science student at the University of the Philippines Mindanao and an aspiring data analyst with a strong interest in transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

I'm excited to bring both my technical and analytical skills into the field of data science to become a data analyst. While still pursuing my studies, I continually challenge myself to work with complex datasets, identify patterns and trends, and refine my analytical thinking.

I’ve gained experience by actively practicing with real-world data and exploring insights related to current issues in society. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new tools, learning modern techniques in data analysis, and expanding my knowledge in this fast-evolving field.

I'm passionate about uncovering insights that inform decisions, tell stories, and help solve real-world problems, and I’m always eager to learn more.
