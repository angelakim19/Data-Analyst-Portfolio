# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
I am an aspiring data analyst with experience in Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI. This portfolio highlights a collection of my personal projects where I explore, analyze, and visualize real-world datasets to extract insights and support data-driven decision-making.

Each project reflects my growing skillset in data storytelling, through analysis and visualization.
