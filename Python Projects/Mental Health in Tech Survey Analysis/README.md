# Mental Health in Tech – Survey Analysis

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes mental health trends in the tech industry using survey data.  
It examines how **gender**, **age**, **family history**, and **workplace interference** influence the likelihood of seeking mental health treatment.  
The objective of this project is to uncover insights that highlight awareness, stigma, and support systems within tech workplaces.

## **Key Insights**
- Younger professionals (**ages 18–35**) are more likely to seek treatment, possibly due to growing awareness and reduced stigma.  
- A significant number of respondents report that **mental health interferes with their work**, emphasizing the need for supportive work environments.  
- Those with a **family history of mental illness** tend to seek treatment more often, suggesting personal exposure may encourage help-seeking behavior.  
- Gender distribution was **cleaned and normalized** to ensure accurate insights from the data.  

These findings can help drive workplace initiatives to **reduce stigma** and **improve mental health support** in the tech industry.

## **Data Cleaning Highlights**
- Standardized **gender categories** (e.g., combining variations of "male" and "female").  
- Removed **unrealistic ages** (kept range between 18–65).  
- Handled **missing values** and inconsistent entries to ensure accuracy.
